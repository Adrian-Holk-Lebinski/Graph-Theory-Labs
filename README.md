# Graph Theory Project
Welcome to my graph theory project on graph isomorphism, this project was started in hopes of learning more about the graph isomorphism problem and learn as much as i can about it.  This project helped me understand the importance of research and that there is still so many things for people to discover and so many problems to solve. Im intruiged by how impactful graphs are in our daily lives in situations you wouldn't even think!

If you come across issues with the code you might have to install the libraries inside the jupyter notebook kernel itself using the following commands:
```
!pip install networkx 
!pip install matplotlib
!pip install numpy
!pip install random
```
You can insert these into any cell and run them.
